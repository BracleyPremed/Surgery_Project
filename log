Today I've added some game objects, interactions, materials as well.
The version control issue is resolved. 
Need a big screen to work on the environment; currently having scaling issue, and physics as well

-Added an interactive game object but was not able to test it because of space issue
-Thinking about create a teleportation system on next session.
